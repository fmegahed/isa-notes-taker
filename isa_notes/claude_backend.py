"""
claude_backend.py — Run the note-writing agent against one of three backends.

Backends:
  subscription (default) — Claude, via the Claude Agent SDK driving the local
      Claude Code CLI. Authenticates with your Claude subscription (Pro/Max):
      log in once with `claude`; no API key. The agent writes the output file
      with its native Write/Edit tools and may use WebFetch/WebSearch.
  codex — GPT, via the OpenAI Codex CLI. Authenticates with your ChatGPT
      subscription: log in once with `codex login`. Custom tools are served
      to Codex over a stdio MCP server (notes_mcp_server.py); the agent
      writes the output file with its own file tools and may use web search.
  api — the Anthropic API with the `anthropic` SDK. Requires
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and bills per token. The agent writes the output file
      through a write_notes tool and may use the server-side web fetch/search
      tools.

Common contract: run_agent() sends a system prompt plus user message, lets the
agent call the tools defined in notes_tools.py (frame extraction, transcript
clarification, ...), and instructs it to write the final LaTeX to
`output_file` rather than into its reply — chat commentary therefore never
pollutes the .tex output. The file's content is returned. Recorded
corrections, preamble additions, and the frame counter land on the passed
NotesToolContext.

ASYNC_QA_INSTRUCTION = """

Questions to the user (ask_user, clarify_transcript) are asynchronous: the
tool queues the question and returns immediately, and the user answers while
you keep working. Do not stop and wait for an answer. Adopt your best
provisional version, mark the spot with
<!-- todo: awaiting answer #N @ hh:mm:ss --> on its own line, and continue.
Always give the question a timestamp, copied from the transcript line it
arose from: it is how the user finds the moment in the recording, and a
question they cannot locate is a question they cannot answer. Tell ask_user
what your provisional choice was, and clarify_transcript your best guess. The
answer may come back in a follow-up run, where you are a fresh context with
no memory of either, and a reply of "yes, that one" is only usable if you are
told what you proposed. Call get_user_answers before you finish, to
incorporate answers that have already arrived; answers that arrive by the end
of your pass are delivered in a follow-up turn, in which you revise the file
(apply the answers and remove the resolved todo comments) rather than
rewriting it. Questions the user has not answered (or has deferred) by then
stay open: keep their todo comments; a later follow-up run resolves them."""

RESEARCH_INSTRUCTION = """

Web research: you have web search and fetch tools — use them freely and
autonomously, without asking, whenever outside material would improve the
notes: the lecturer names a paper, book, or set of notes; a term or theorem
attribution sounds off; you are unsure of the standard notation, definition,
or convention for something niche or recent. Do not rely on memory for
material you are not certain about — checking is cheap, a wrong definition in
the notes is not. For arXiv papers and PDFs prefer the fetch_document tool; use
web search when you do not have a URL yet. Fetched papers are cached on disk
and the tool result lists the local paths — the TeX source tree, the
rendered PDF, sometimes HTML. Open those files directly with your own file
tools instead of re-fetching: read the source for exact macros and
notation, and open the PDF (view_pdf_page, or your native PDF reading if you
have it) whenever you need the typeset form — in particular to check the
resolved theorem/equation numbers, which raw TeX source cannot show, and
whenever extracted text or HTML looks garbled."""
