"""
notes_tools.py — Tool definitions and handlers for the note-writing agent,
shared by every backend (Claude subscription, Codex, Anthropic API).

The tool surface is parameterized by a NotesToolContext:
  - get_frame is offered only when a video is available;
  - add_to_preamble is offered only in course mode (build_course.py).

Handlers are synchronous and may block (stdin prompts, ffmpeg). They mutate
the context (recorded corrections, preamble additions, frame counter); when
ctx.state_file is set — as in the MCP subprocess spawned for the Codex
backend — every mutation is also persisted there so the parent process can
pick it up after the run.

Diagnostics go to stderr: inside the Codex MCP subprocess, stdout is the
protocol channel and must stay clean. Interactive prompts fall back to
/dev/tty when stdin is not a terminal (again: the MCP subprocess).

business analytics class. The screen shows one of: RStudio (source pane,
console, environment, viewer), a rendered R Markdown page, slides, a browser,
or a GUI tool such as Tableau, Power BI, Flourish, or DataWrapper. You are
given context and one or more video frames (or a get_frame tool to fetch
them; it may return the image directly or save it to a file for you to open).

Produce a report on what is shown that is relevant to the context:
- Transcribe visible code and console output exactly, in a fenced block,
  including error messages. Say which pane it is in.
- For a GUI, name the window, menu, dialog, field names, and what is
  selected or highlighted, in the order a user would read them.
- For a chart or table, describe the type, axes, fields, and any visible
  values or labels.
- Say explicitly where content is cut off by the frame edge, covered by
  another window, blurred, or too small to read, and which parts of your
  transcription are uncertain because of it.
- If the frame shows a screen share by someone other than the instructor
  (a name overlay that is not the instructor's, or a different desktop),
  say so first: that frame must not be embedded in the notes.

Frames may be mid-transition; when you can fetch frames yourself, try nearby
timestamps to get a clearer view before reporting. Report only what is
visible. Never invent or complete code or values. Flagging something as
unreadable is always better than guessing."""

    the first few thousand characters of a file, which is what this used to
    do, samples the preface: the least representative page in any set of
    notes, and the one most likely to be a list of conventions.

    The instruction deliberately does NOT claim the exemplar is unrelated to
    the lecture. The best exemplar is often the closest one — the same
    author's own written-up notes on neighbouring material, which is where
    their register is most visible — and telling the model that a document
    plainly about the same subject is "unrelated" is both false and
    self-defeating: a model that spots the falsehood has reason to discount
    the whole instruction. What has to be said instead is the true thing,
